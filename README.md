This repository contains the source code of the [Safetogether Specification]
which aims to be a clear, unambiguous, free and implementable documentation for [Safetogether Project].

For the time being, while the migration is in progress, please refer also to the existing draft documents available in reference implementation repositories.

A fair number of spec improvements are currently in the making. If you want to contribute, please refer to a relevant [panel](https://safe-together.github.io/specification/panels/).
